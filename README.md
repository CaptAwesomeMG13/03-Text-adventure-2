# 03-Text-adventure

This is my solution to the 03-Text adventure assignment for MSCH-C220. I have included a couple of .json game description files for anyone to play with.

main_simple.py contains the code we worked out in class (or a close approximation to it). It runs the zork.json file, as long as it is in the same directory.

main.py is a little more complicated. 

Features to add at some point
 * Objects in the world
 * inventory management
 * Points (for objects acquired or locations visited)
 * Flags for accomplished events
 * Conditional exits (based on flags)
 * etc.

 In this assignment, I tried to build a simple text game model using json. By using the template in the json file, I followed the design of my game step by step, including entering the game target, and every step of the process was added into the program step by step. If the guide player can through my game to win the final victory. My game "candy" allows you to become the owner of the candy garden by collecting three main candies from the candy garden. The three kinds of candy are fruit drop, chocolate and cotton candy.
